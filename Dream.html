  <div class="center-text">
    <p>  Close your eyes and listen. What do you see when the world grows quiet?  
      Dreams are not always logical. They're glowing fragments of who we are and who we could be.  
      In dreams, we fly. We rebuild. We remember. We escape.</p>

    <p>  Dreams are made of stars and silence, woven from hopes too shy to speak.  
      In our sleep, we visit places untouched by time.  
      And in the morning, some of us try to bring those places to life.</p>

      “All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds 
      wake in the day to find that it was vanity. But the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, 
      for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.”  
      <br>— T.E. Lawrence

    </ul>
    <p>Every great journey begins with a dream. What’s yours?</p>
